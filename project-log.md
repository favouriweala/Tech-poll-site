## Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `eslint.config.mjs` - ESLint configuration

## Database Schema
The application uses a well-structured PostgreSQL database via Supabase with the following main tables:

1. **profiles** - Extended user information
2. **polls** - Main poll data (title, description, settings)
3. **poll_options** - Individual poll choices
4. **votes** - User votes on poll options

Key features of the schema:
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Support for anonymous voting via IP tracking
- Flexible poll settings (multiple choice, public/private, time limits)
- Performance-optimized with proper indexing
- Database views for statistics and results

## Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Pending Tasks
1. **Real-time Features**: Implement real-time poll results updates using Supabase subscriptions
2. **Poll Analytics**: Create detailed analytics and reporting features  
3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive integration and E2E tests
